    <p>
      <a href="https://securityonionsolutions.com/" taget="new_blank">Security Onion</a> is a free, open-source security information and event management (SIEM)
      software that can assist with packet analysis in a large enterprise network. Intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) can produce large of amount of data
      quickly and SIEM software such as Security Onion can organize and identify threats in a timely manner. Downloading the software also includes other third party tools
      such as Sguil and Wireshark, which can be used to further analyze threat risks. 
    </p>

      Using 
      <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/" target="new_blank">Microsoft Hyper-V Type 1 HyperVisor</a>
      , multiple virtual machines (VM) were used to create the enviroment needed to utiltize the SIEM software.

    <ul>
      <li>RT1-LOCAL, RT-2-ISP, RT3-INT (VyOS Routers/Switches)</li>
      <li>SIEM1 (Security Onion v16)</li>

  <div class="row fw-bold p-0 m-0 mb-3">Sniffing Placement</div>
  <div class="row m-0 p-0 mb-1">
    <p>
      In an ideal scenerio, an IDS or similar sniffing sensors would be placed at every node in a network. This is not cost effective and inefficient
      for data gathering so strategic placement must take place. A router's internal interface is a common place to configure port mirroring for sensor frame gathering. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Security Onion is installed on SIEM1 and has two <em>eth</em> interfaces, both connected to the RT1-LOCAL switch.
      eth0 is configured with an IP address (10.1.0.246) and is used to manage the application. eth1 has no IP address and is configured as a destination interface
      for sniffing the mirrored frames. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row m-0 p-0 mb-1">
    In Hyper-V, select RT1-LOCAL->right click->Settings...->select eth0 VLOCAL->Advanced Features->Port Mirroring->Mirroring Mode->Source. Confirm by selecting OK.
  </div>
  <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/mirroring.png" alt="mirroring setting"></div>
  
  <div class="row fw-bold p-0 m-0 mb-3">Alert Management</div>
  <div class="row m-0 p-0 mb-1">
  <p>
    Security Onion uses <a href="https://bammv.github.io/sguil/" target="new_blank">Sguil</a> to manage alerts generated by an IDS.
    Alerts can be selected and further analyzed by various third party tools within the user interface (UI). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Start SIEM1->start Sguili->select siem-eth1-start SGUIL. The ST column has color-coded priority for each alert, red being the highest. 
    The CNT column shows the number of packets matching the alert. When selecting the alert with ID 3.19 and reading the event message, Emergin Threats ruleset syntax can be observed.
    ET rulesets are open-source and applied by various SIEM applications such as Security Onion. SCAN is one of the classification types within ET rulesets.
    The short timeframe the alerts are received in would indicate a network scan performed by tools such as Nmap. 
  </p>
  <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/ET.png" alt="ET Scan"></div>
  <p>
    Rule ID 3.20 and 3.27 displayed similar alerts to 3.19.
    Right-clicking the value 4 in the CNT column for alert 3.27->select Correlated Events. This shows all individual packets that were identified as a single event.
  </p>
  <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/correlated.png" alt="correlated events"></div>
  <p>
    Right-clicking the Alert ID field for a packet provides a menu of third party tools to perform further analysis. 
    Right-clicking the Src IP field gives paths to the relevant data stored somewhere else in the database (via Kibana lookup) or via a search or CTI provider over the Internet.
  </p>
  <div class="row mb-5">
    <img src="images/third.png" alt="third party tools" class="col-lg-6 mb-1">
    <img src="images/database.png" alt="database ip lookup" class="col-lg-6 mb-1">
  </div>
  <p>
    Alerts can manually be categorized in SGUIL. 
    Right clicking a value in the ST column->select Update Event Status brings up multiple categories that can be applied to each alert.
  </p>
  <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/status.png" alt="update event status"></div>
</div>
  
<div class="row fw-bold p-0 m-0 mb-3">Prioritize Alerts</div>
  <div class="row m-0 p-0 mb-3">
    <p>
      Alerts with higher priority should be investigated first. 
      Alert 3.31 shows packet captures of a Tibs downloader Trojan trying to connect to a website and download a suspicious file.
    </p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/trojan.png" alt="trojan"></div>
    <p>
      Alert 3.35 has a higher packet count indicating a large data download.
      Bro (Zeek) reveals content with text and html, but doesn't indicate a web page. The Zeek "MZ" magic number signature marks the string as binary code for a Windows executable. 
      This code can be copied for reverse engineering of possible malware later if needed. 
      It can also be used with other third party tools like NetworkMiner or Wireshark for sandbox analysis. 
    </p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/zeek.png" alt="zeek code"></div>
    <p>
      Alerts 3.90 and 3.91 reference a diffrent threat using Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs. 
      The threat signature detected shows an attempt to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability to run arbitrary commands through the web server&apos;s shell.
    </p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/cve.png" alt="CVE"></div>
    <p>
      Alert ID 3.95 show another Trojan being downloaded over port 80 (HTTP), followed by suspicious outbound traffic over port 443 (HTTPS). 
      Using Wireshark to analyze the traffic, a legitimate session should be seen starting with a SSL/TLS handshake to exchange encrpyted packets. 
      The packets observed use a plaintext HTTP POST and an encrypted message.
    </p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/trojan2.png" alt="trojan 2"></div>
    The public IP address 24.121.176.48 should be checked against IP reputation blacklists, preferably automated for proactive response to threats. 
</div>

<div class="row fw-bold p-0 m-0 mb-3">Adding Custom Rules</div>
  <div class="row m-0 p-0 mb-1">
    <p>
      Custom rules for alerts are usually configured for specific network needs.
      Rules can be written in configuration txt files on the same VM as the SIEM software. 
      On SIEM1, the following command was used on the local terminal to open and modify the sample Snort custom rule file.
    </p>
    <code>sudo nano /etc/nsm/rules/local.rules</code>
    <p>
      The first rule had its comment command removed to activate its use in the SIEM alerts.
    </p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/rule.png" alt="rule"></div>
    <p>
      Each rule has a header plus a body, which is enclosed in brackets. 
      The header includes the action, protocol, source host or network, source port, direction, target host or network, and target port. 
      The body must include at least an identifier (sid:) and a message (msg:). 
      A local rule should have an SID of 1000000 or greater. 
      The parts of the body are delimited by semicolons.
      $HOME_NET is a variable set in the snort.conf file to the local network IP addresses. The configuration file would be viewed using 
    </p>
    <code class="mb-3">cat /etc/nsm/siem-eth1/snort.conf | less</code>
    <p>When done editing the ruleset, the following command was written to run the Snort Pulled Pork Script to force update the ruleset.</p>
    <code>sudo rule-update</code>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/update.png" alt="update"></div>
  <p>The following command was used to makesure the new rule downloaded properly:</p>
  <code>tail /etc/nsm/rules/downloaded.rules</code>
  <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/check.png" alt="check"></div>
  <p>From the LAMP VM, a ping of the RT1-LOCAL switch (10.1.0.1), SIEM1 (10.1.0.246), and RT3-INT (172.16.0.254) were performed to test the new ruleset.</p>
  <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/ping.png" alt="ping"></div>
  <p>Going back to the SIEM VM shows the custom rule generated along with the default alert.</p>
  <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/test.png" alt="test rule"></div>
</div>

<div class="row fw-bold p-0 m-0 mb-3">Managing Custom Rules</div>
  <div class="row m-0 p-0 mb-1">
    <p>
      Ping rules will flag often in a large network and generate a lot of false positive alerts.
      The second rule comment command was removed to modify the orginal rule to restrict to certain segments of the network.
    </p>
    <code class="mb-3">alert icmp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:“External ICMP probe detected”; sid:1000001; rev:2;)</code>
    <p>
      After force updating the file, 10.1.0.1 was pinged on the LAMP VM to test the message.
      On SIEM1, the new alert message was generated.
    </p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/test2.png" alt="test 2"></div>
    <p>On DC1, a ping was sent 10.1.0.254 and 172.16.0.254. When Sguil was checked, no alert was generated for RT3-INT which was outside the network segment.</p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/rule2.png" alt="rule 2"></div>
    <p>The last rule revision was added to the rulset file and updated.</p>
    <code>alert icmp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (itype:8; msg:“External ICMP probe detected”; detection_filter:track by_src,count 20,seconds 30; priority:4; classtype:icmp-event; sid:1000001; rev:3;)</code>
    <p>On DC1, SIEM1 and RT3-INT were pinged again. No alerts were triggered when Sguil was checked on SIEM1, which means the new threashold of 20 is active.</p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/test3.png" alt="test 3"></div>
    <p>On LAMP, RT3-LOCAL was pinged with a count of 40.</p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/40.png" alt="40 ping"></div>
    <p>When Sguil was checked, the low priority alert triggered as well as the default ET ruleset.</p>
    <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/test4.png" alt="test 4"></div>
